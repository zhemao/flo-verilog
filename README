flo-verilog
============

This package provides tools for converting the "flo" files generated by
Chisel and flo-torture into verilog for synthesis and simulation.

flo2v - Takes as its argument a flo file and produces a similarly named
verilog file. (i.e. "flo2v module.flo" produces file module.v)

step2tb - Takes as its argument a step file and a file file and produces
a verilog testbench. "flo2v module.step module.flo" produces a testbench
named module_tb.v.
